# wk4-code-quiz
This is the repo for the week 4 challenge 

The task was to develop a quiz code relating to the javascript topic we learned this past week. In addition to that, the task was to add a timer that penalises as well as a leaderboard that records the score.

# User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
